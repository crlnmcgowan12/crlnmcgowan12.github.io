    <h2>About Sankalp</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Sankalp, a UNCC student passionate about building helpful campus tools.
       Campus Life Hub is designed to make student life easier by putting events and resources in one place.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>To help students stay informed, connected, and involved across campus.</p>

    <h3>Why I Built This</h3>
    <p>I noticed that club events, workshops, and services were scattered across different platforms.
       This site brings everything together in a simple and accessible format.
